## Why?

`wp-content/mu-plugins` is designed to only support plugins in a single file. HM Custom Meta Boxes has clearly more than one file.
It also helps to keep the wp-content directory of your project as clean as possible. It should actually be empty because you're loading everything through composer. ðŸ˜‰
